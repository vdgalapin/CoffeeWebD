          <p>This is the go-to coffee shop of most of dumaguetenos because it’s affordable and good enough for its price. Kapeng local is located near the beach coast of Dumaguete hence why people enjoy getting their coffee there and sit by the seawall and talk. Menu? I would say they have a quite a lot of options too, they have drip-based coffee and non-coffee. Two sizes to choose from which is regular and giant (btw their giant is like twice the size of their regular size) prices vary too of course. Regular sized drinks range from 50.00 – 85 pesos and their giants for 95.00 – 160.00 pesos. What to get? I would recommend getting their Spanish latte if you want a sweet, creamy blend for your coffee, matcha espresso, and their iced matcha. Cons? They don’t really have one unless you have set a high standard for your coffee then I would say just don’t expect much.</p>
