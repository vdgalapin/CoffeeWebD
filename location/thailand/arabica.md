            You’ve probably seen % Arabica before - it’s one of those coffee brands known around the world for its sleek aesthetic and minimalist design. So when we found one in Bangkok, we figured it was time to finally give it a try. The setup was pretty cool, to be honest. The café had this modern staircase-style seating where you could chill on giant steps with little tables scattered around. It definitely had that Instagram-friendly vibe going for it.
            <br />
            The menu had some fancy-sounding drinks, which made me feel like I was stepping into some high-end coffee ritual. But also… the prices matched that vibe - definitely on the expensive side. I went for the cheapest item I could find because I wasn’t ready to drop a fortune on a coffee I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy. And when I got my drink, it came in a paper cup. And you know how I feel about paper cups - not a fan, especially when I’m paying a premium.
            <br />
            Taste-wise, the coffee was just okay. Nothing mind-blowing. It was a bit on the lighter side, less creamy than I’d hoped, especially for the price. I expected something a bit more indulgent, a bit more flavorful. It didn’t hit that mark for me.
            <br />
            The crowd inside felt like the low-key rich type - dressed casually but clearly dripping with quiet money. It made the whole atmosphere feel a bit off for me, like I didn’t quite belong. Still, we took some decent photos, and I can’t deny the place looked great.
            <br />
            Would I recommend it? If you’re into stylish cafés and want a photogenic spot to check off your list, sure. 
            It’s definitely one for the travel aesthetic. But if you’re in it for the coffee and not the vibe - or if you’re on a budget - there are better (and creamier) options out there.
