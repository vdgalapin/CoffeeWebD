            Our first coffee stop in Pattaya was Stir It House Coffee, and it was exactly the kind of spot we needed after a long, two-hour morning drive. We were tired, just arriving in town, and looking for something calm and cozy to recharge. We stumbled upon this café and decided to give it a shot - and we’re glad we did.
            <br />
            The prices were surprisingly affordable, especially for a place in a tourist-heavy area. Pattaya can sometimes be pricey, but this café felt like a hidden gem. It’s not right in the middle of everything, but it’s still very accessible. We were the only customers there, which gave it a super chill, relaxed vibe. We ordered a couple of drinks and tried what I think was a cheesecake or cheese cupcake - either way, it was solid for the price.
            Now let me tell you about Chubi, the cat. This place isn’t a cat café, but Chubi definitely stole the show. 
            <br />
            He’s a sweet, mellow cat who doesn’t give you that usual cold cat stare - just pure, laid-back energy. He instantly took a liking to my girlfriend, which, I won’t lie, made me a little jealous. Dude kept going up to her like they were old friends. Still, it made the experience even better.
            <br />
            The space itself was aesthetic and peaceful - not overly decorated, but clean and thoughtfully designed. It’s the kind of café where you actually want to slow down, enjoy your drink, and just be present. Great lighting for photos, too.
            <br />
            If you’re in Pattaya and looking for a quiet, cozy spot to sip your coffee (and maybe meet a charming cat), Stir It House Coffee is definitely worth the stop. Just watch out - Chubi might charm your date before you do.
