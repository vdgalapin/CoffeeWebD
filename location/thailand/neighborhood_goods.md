            While exploring Old Town Chiang Mai on foot - something I really enjoy doing - I decided to check out a café I found on Google Maps called The Neighborhood Goods. The reviews were almost perfect, with people praising the coffee and atmosphere, so naturally, I wanted to give it a shot.
            <br />
            The walk there was nice, but finding the place was a bit tricky. I was expecting something larger or more noticeable - maybe a big white-and-red building - but when I arrived, it turned out to be a tiny spot tucked away on a quiet corner. The space inside was just as small, and while there were a decent number of chairs, it felt more cramped than cozy.
            Their coffee menu was very basic, and to be honest, the prices were higher than I expected for such a minimalist setup. I decided to take my coffee to go, and unfortunately, it didn’t live up to the reviews. It was just… not great. Definitely not worth the price, and I walked away regretting the choice.
            <br />
            That said, the barista was kind and spoke English really well, which I appreciated. So while the service was friendly, the coffee and overall experience just didn’t match the high praise I saw online.
            <br />
            Maybe I caught them on an off day - or maybe the style just isn’t for me - but The Neighborhood Goods wasn’t a place I’d go back to. If you’re curious, feel free to check it out for yourself, but personally, I think there are much better coffee options around Chiang Mai that offer more value and flavor for the price.
