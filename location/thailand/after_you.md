            One of the best café experiences I had in Bangkok was at After You. We didn’t even realize how popular it was at first - we just saw a branch near the mall with a line of people waiting outside. Turns out, it’s one of the most well-loved dessert cafés in Thailand, often compared to Starbucks in terms of popularity. We got curious and decided to check it out.
            <br/>
            At first glance, the café looked pretty upscale, and I honestly expected the prices to match the fancy atmosphere. Coming from the Philippines, I found the menu slightly pricey - around the same cost as Starbucks back home - and that made me a bit hesitant to order anything beyond the basics. I played it safe and got a café latte, while my girlfriend decided to try something more exciting: a croffle with ice cream.
            <br/>
            That croffle completely blew us away. It was buttery, crispy, and warm, perfectly paired with the smooth, not-too-sweet ice cream on top. It instantly became one of our most memorable café desserts. Ever since that day, my girlfriend has been craving croffles wherever we go. Nothing else has quite matched that first bite at After You.
            <br/>
            Even though we kept it simple with our orders, the quality and flavor were enough to leave a lasting impression. The vibe of the café was cozy yet modern, with just the right balance of comfort and class. It wasn’t just a quick coffee stop - it felt like a full experience.
            If you ever find yourself in Bangkok, don’t skip After You. Be prepared to wait a bit, especially during peak hours, but know that it’s absolutely worth it. Whether you go for a drink, dessert, or both, it’s one of those places that makes you appreciate the little indulgences in life.
