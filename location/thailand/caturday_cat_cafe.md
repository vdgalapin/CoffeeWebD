            If you’re in Bangkok and looking for a coffee spot with a twist, Caturday Cat Café might just catch your curiosity. It’s exactly what it sounds like - a café filled with cats. Lots of them. The vibe is cozy, chill, and full of feline energy… or lack thereof.
            <br/>
            We went in expecting a fun time petting cats while sipping coffee. The entrance is technically free, but you’re required to order a minimum amount to get access to the cat area, which is fair enough. Once inside, we were surrounded by cats - some slow, some stylish-looking like they’d been through art school, and others that just radiated “don’t touch me” energy. Honestly, most of them were nonchalant and acted like we didn’t exist. If you’ve met cats before, you know the vibe - but compared to other cat cafés we’ve visited, these ones were definitely on the snobby side.
            <br/>
            The seating style is Japanese-inspired - low tables and cushions on the floor. Cool aesthetic, but not the most comfortable setup if you’re not used to it. We didn’t come for the food, and frankly, I don’t even remember much about the coffee. The whole experience was really about the cats… even though the cats weren’t that into us.
            <br/>
            Despite all that, I’d still say Caturday is one of the better cat cafés I’ve been to. It’s well-maintained, has a good variety of cats, and the environment feels thoughtfully put together. Just don’t expect cuddly kittens climbing all over you - it’s more of a “look, not touch” kind of place.
