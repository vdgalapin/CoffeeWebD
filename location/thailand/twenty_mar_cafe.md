            Our first coffee stop in Chiang Mai was Twenty Mar Café, and it definitely made a visual impression. The place had a clean, modern bar setup - sleek counter, moody lighting, and a very “aesthetic café” kind of vibe. The guy behind the bar had long hair and surfer energy, but he was Thai - spoke English really well and made us feel welcome without trying too hard. Cool dude.
            <br/>
            We checked out the menu and saw the prices were a bit on the higher end, but since we were already there, we decided to roll with it. I ordered a Thai-style cappuccino - something new for us. The drink came out in a tiny glass, super fancy-looking, but I couldn’t help feeling like it was too small for the price. You know what I mean - it’s not that I want a giant cup, but just enough to feel like I got my money’s worth.
            <br/>
            The coffee itself? Really good. No complaints on the flavor. It was rich and smooth, something you could tell was made with care. But the overall vibe of the place wasn’t really our scene. It was quiet, filled with ultra-aesthetic folks (mostly Korean tourists when we were there), and just had that “look cool and sip slowly” energy. We were just kind of there, taking a few photos, sipping our tiny coffee, and scrolling on our phones. Not exactly a spot for real talk or laughs - too quiet for that.
            <br/>
            Music was playing, but low - not enough to drown out conversations, which made us feel like even talking normally would be too loud. It’s a vibe, for sure, just not our usual one.
            <br/>
            All in all, Twenty Mar Café is great if you’re into minimal interiors, creative coffee, and snapping clean Instagram shots. But if you’re looking for a place to hang, talk, and chill out comfortably - this might be a one-and-done stop.
