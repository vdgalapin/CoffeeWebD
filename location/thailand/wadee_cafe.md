            WADEE.CAFE was the very first coffee shop we visited in Bangkok, and while it didn’t exactly blow us away, it did set the tone for our caffeine adventures across the city. The place itself was fine - clean, quiet, and easy to find. It wasn’t particularly memorable, but sometimes a simple start is all you need.
            <br/>
            The coffee? Also just okay. Nothing too special or standout about it, but considering the price, I didn’t feel disappointed. It was affordable and accessible, especially for someone visiting Bangkok for the first time. If you’re just looking for a quick coffee stop that won’t hurt your wallet, WADEE.CAFE does the job.
            <br/>
            One thing we really appreciated was the friendly barista who could speak English. That made the experience smoother and more relaxed for us. It was also a great walking area - the walk to the café was scenic, and we got to take in a bit of the local neighborhood vibe, which added to the charm.
            <br/>
            While the coffee might not stick in my memory, I actually got a great photo inside - nice lighting and a clean aesthetic wall that made it Instagram-worthy. That one shot ended up being one of my favorite pictures from the trip.
            <br/>
            Would I recommend WADEE.CAFE? Sure, if you’re nearby and want something affordable and easy. It’s not a must-visit, but it’s a solid option for a casual cup in a relaxed setting.
