            Out of all the cafés I’ve been to in Thailand - Samorn, Arabica, cat cafés, aesthetic spots - Samorn Café in Chiang Mai easily takes the top spot. Not just for the coffee (which is already amazing), but for the real stars of the place: the dogs. And not just any dogs - small, long, ridiculously cute dogs that will make you want to come back every single day. We did. We literally went four out of the five days we stayed in Chiang Mai.
            <br />
            Samorn is a dog café done right. The space is clean - all white and minimalist - and you wouldn’t even know there are dogs inside until you see them walking around. It’s super aesthetic, the kind of spot that just feels good to be in. And for a place full of animals, it’s shockingly spotless. Major props for that.
            <br/>
            Now, the coffee. Smooth, flavorful, and just the right amount of punch to start your day. The price is fair - not cheap, but not high-end either. For the quality and the environment, it’s 100% worth it. Their dessert menu looked solid too, though we were usually too distracted by the dogs to focus much on sweets.
            <br/>
            Language-wise, the staff didn’t speak much English, but that didn’t stop us from getting exactly what we wanted. We just pointed at what looked good, and they got it right every time. The only downside? The seating isn’t super comfy - small chairs, nothing fancy - but who cares when you’re surrounded by adorable dogs?
            <br/>
            Some of the puppies weren’t too into being pet, but the older dogs? Total sweethearts. I even picked one up like it was my own dog. We took so many photos, it felt like we had adopted one for the day. We started calling one of them our “dog son,” and honestly, it felt right.
            <br/>
            If you’re ever in Chiang Mai, go to Samorn Café. Even if you’re not a huge dog person, the vibe, the coffee, and the experience make it unforgettable. I’d go back in a heartbeat - and I’ll keep telling everyone I know to go too.
