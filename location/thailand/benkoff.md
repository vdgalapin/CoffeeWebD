            When we heard about BENKOFF in Bangkok, we were genuinely excited. The main draw? Supposedly, there was a live dachshund you could hang out with while sipping your coffee. Being big dog lovers - especially dachshunds - we thought it would be the perfect little side trip. But when we got there, our excitement quickly turned into disappointment.
            <br/>
            Everything in the café was dachshund-themed - from the wallpaper and merch to the cups and branding. Even the food menu had sausages, which felt like a cheeky nod to the breed. But here’s the thing: no dachshund. We looked around, waited, and even tried to ask - but nope, not a single sausage dog in sight. It felt a little misleading, especially since that was the whole reason we chose to visit.
            <br/>
            Despite the lack of a warm welcome or much customer interaction, we didn’t really mind that part. We ordered two coffees and some food anyway. But then came another letdown: they served the drinks in paper cups, even though we were dining in. Personally, I’m not a fan of paper cups - especially when I’m paying a premium. The coffee itself? Not bad. It was creamy and smooth, but the portion was tiny for the price. I don’t remember the exact amount, but it definitely didn’t feel worth it.
            <br/>
            We also tried the sausage, thinking it’d be hearty and flavorful. Instead, what we got was a mini-sized serving that barely made a dent in our appetite. It felt like the dachshund theme extended all the way to the portion size - which, while funny in hindsight, wasn’t so great at the time.
            <br/>
            All in all, BENKOFF looked cute from the outside and had a fun concept, but it didn’t deliver on what we came for. If you’re expecting to meet an actual dachshund, lower your expectations. It’s a one-time experience for us - and honestly, there are way better coffee spots in Bangkok that offer more value, more heart, and real atmosphere.
