            One morning in Chiang Mai, I decided to head out solo and walk around the Old Town just to see what I could find. I ended up at The Man-Made Coffee Shop - not a big café or a trendy spot, but more like a coffee cart setup with a few chairs scattered around. It reminded me a bit of the sidewalk coffee culture in Vietnam. Nothing fancy, just simple and straight to the point.
            <br />
            The walk to get there was longer than I expected, but the cool morning weather made it feel refreshing instead of exhausting. When I arrived, I checked the prices and was pleasantly surprised - very affordable, especially compared to what I’m used to paying back in the 
            Philippines. I ordered a coffee and kept my expectations in check.
            <br />
            Taste-wise, it wasn’t anything mind-blowing, but it got the job done. It’s the kind of coffee you’d grab for a quick caffeine hit rather than a deep, slow sip. Still, the experience made up for it. The guy running the cart was friendly, spoke English well, and even gave me a few suggestions for other things to try in town. It was one of those interactions that feels small but makes your day a little better.
            <br />
            If you’re living in Chiang Mai or just staying nearby and want something fast, cheap, and local - The Man-Made Coffee Shop is worth a stop. It’s not about aesthetics or premium coffee blends. It’s just honest, simple, and reliable - perfect for a casual morning or when you just need to recharge during a walk through the city.
