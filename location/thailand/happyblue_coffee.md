            On our last day in Chiang Mai, we were looking for a place to just chill. We had already checked out of our hotel, left our luggage at the front desk, and had a long wait before our late-night flight - somewhere around 11 PM. After visiting three or four coffee shops in just a couple of days, we were honestly coffeed-out. But we still needed somewhere to hang out, relax, and kill some time.
            <br/>
            That’s how we found Happy Blue Coffee, tucked away in the Old City area. I spotted it on Google Maps, and since it was close to our hotel, we figured we’d give it a shot. And man, it turned out to be a really good call.
            The place had a warm, homely vibe - nothing too flashy, just simple and comforting. It kind of felt like walking into someone’s living room. There were a few foreigners quietly working on laptops, soft music playing, and just an overall peaceful energy. The barista (or maybe the owner?) spoke great English and was super friendly, which made everything smooth from the start.
            <br/>
            Instead of more coffee, we ordered lemon tea and a croffle - and both hit the spot. Light, tasty, and perfect for a break from all the caffeine. The space had everything we needed: good music, fast Wi-Fi, comfy seating, and even free water. It was the perfect little pocket of calm in the middle of the Old City.
            <br/>
            If you’re in Chiang Mai, especially in the Old City area, and need a quiet place to rest, work, or just cool down - Happy Blue Coffee is 100% worth checking out. Nothing over-the-top, just solid drinks, a chill atmosphere, and good people running the place.
