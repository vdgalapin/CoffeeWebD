            I stumbled into 1st For Coffee while wandering around Chiang Mai’s Old Town, just looking for something simple: a cheap café with air conditioning. It was one of those humid days where the sun feels like it’s sitting on your shoulder, so finding a cool spot was top priority. That’s when I found this place - quiet, tucked away, and exactly what I needed.
            <br />
            As I stepped in, there was this guy talking to himself - or rather, to his laptop - but he wasn’t loud enough to ruin the peace. I barely noticed him after a few minutes. The barista, who also handled the register, greeted me with a smile and spoke English really well. I ordered a hot cappuccino, which came out quickly, and to my surprise, she also served a glass of iced tea on the side - totally free. That small gesture hit the spot, especially after walking around in the heat.
            The coffee was good, the space was cool, and there was free Wi-Fi. It had everything I was looking for, and nothing felt forced or overly fancy. I was just relaxing, sipping coffee, and waiting for my girlfriend to finish her shift so we could head out later that night.
            <br />
            Then out of nowhere, the laptop guy started chatting with me. He introduced himself as a Vietnamese guy teaching German - not sure why, maybe trying to flex in front of the barista? It was random, a little odd, but honestly didn’t ruin the vibe.
            <br />
            1st For Coffee isn’t flashy or Instagram-famous, but it’s one of those spots that does what a café should do: give you a comfortable place to sit, enjoy a good drink, and escape the heat for a while. If you’re roaming around Old Town and need a solid, no-fuss coffee break - this is a great place to drop into.
