            The Improvised Coffee was one of those unexpected finds during our casual walk around Chiang Mai’s Old Town. My girlfriend and I were just exploring with no real destination in mind - slightly tired, slightly lost, and in desperate need of a caffeine fix. Then I spotted a poster advertising egg coffee, and my interest instantly kicked in. After just getting back from Ho Chi Minh City - where I became hooked on Vietnam’s signature egg coffee - I couldn’t pass this up.
            <br />
            I stepped in with high hopes. The price was a bit more than what I was used to in Vietnam, but I figured that was expected - we weren’t in Hanoi anymore. What surprised me, though, was the size. It was smaller than what I had in Vietnam and looked more “minimalist café” than “rich, indulgent street drink.” Taste-wise, it leaned sweeter, and while it wasn’t quite the same, it still satisfied my craving.
            <br />
            The café itself has a cool, creative layout. The main structure looks like it was built out of shipping containers - and it kind of feels like you’re hanging out on a container ship, in the best way possible. There’s a small, cozy container space where you can sit if you’ve ordered something, plus an upstairs seating area and a larger open-air section with big fans to keep things breezy.
            <br />
            It’s definitely not your average café. The design is quirky, the seating options are varied, and there’s plenty of space to just chill - especially if you want to enjoy your coffee slowly and escape the Chiang Mai heat.
            <br />
            Would I go back? If I’m ever craving egg coffee again while in Chiang Mai, for sure. The Improvised Coffee may not beat the Vietnamese original, but it offers something different - and in a city full of café options, it earns points for being memorable and bold with its concept.
