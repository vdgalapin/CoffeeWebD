            We found Roast8ry Café (spelled “Roast” with the number 8 in the middle – Roast8ry) on TikTok, where coffee enthusiasts were hyping it up like it was the spot for high-end brews in Chiang Mai. As self-declared café explorers, we figured we’d check it out. But man… this one was a complete letdown from the start.
            <br/>
            First off, the place is far. It’s located way outside Chiang Mai’s Old City, so we made a bit of a trek to get there. But the worst part? We couldn’t even find the entrance. There was construction going on, and what looked like a vent or side panel turned out to be the actual side door - no signs, no guidance, no one helping despite us clearly looking confused from outside. When we finally found what seemed like the main entrance, it was barely held together with what looked like a piece of electrical wire. Not exactly the warm welcome we expected.
            <br/>
            Once inside, things didn’t get much better. The menu? Weird. The drink names were so out there we couldn’t tell what we were even ordering. Nothing was clearly labeled, and for a coffee shop, it felt like they were trying way too hard to be “different.” Add to that the insane prices - some of the highest we saw in Chiang Mai - and we were already in regret mode before our drinks even arrived.
            <br/>
            I tried to go fancy and ordered a “chicken espresso” or something like that - no clue what the name meant, honestly. What I got was a canned coffee. Not joking - the drink literally came in a can, and I had to pop it open like I was at 7-Eleven. I couldn’t believe it. It felt gimmicky, overpriced, and completely underwhelming. My girlfriend’s drink? Equally disappointing. It tasted like watered-down cheap coffee.
            <br/>
            Sure, the place had that polished, industrial aesthetic - lots of dark tones, “bar-style” seating - but the vibe was cold and uncomfortable. It felt more like an office trying to pose as a café. The whole experience just felt off, forced, and pretentious.
            Would I go back? Absolutely not. Roast8ry might be for someone who’s really into the niche coffee scene, but if you actually want to enjoy your drink and feel welcome, there are way better cafés in Chiang Mai. This one? All looks, no soul.
