            If you’re heading to Ho Chi Minh City and love checking out cafés, you’ve probably heard of the Café Apartments - a multi-story building packed with coffee shops, boutiques, and Instagrammable corners. It’s one of the city’s most popular hangout spots, especially for café lovers. One of the cafés we visited there was Good Day, which is located at the very top.
            <br />
            Now, here’s the funny part - to get to Good Day, we took the elevator… but you have to pay to use it. Not a lot, just a small fee, but still - it’s a bit weird if you’re not expecting it. I guess if you want to save that money (and burn some calories), you can take the stairs. It’s not too high, but trust me, you’ll feel it.
            <br />
            Once we got up there, the view made it worth it. You’re right above the city with this breezy, open patio-type setup that feels peaceful and stylish. The ambiance is definitely geared toward the aesthetic crowd - think rooftop vibes, chill music, and the kind of place you want to take photos at. It’s got that whole “Instagram café” thing down.
            <br />
            As for the coffee? It was alright. Honestly, we’ve had better - especially considering the price. Good Day is definitely on the pricier side compared to other spots in Ho Chi Minh. We ordered some food too - a pizza, and… well, let’s just say it didn’t live up to the price tag. Tiny portion, not very satisfying.
            <br />
            That said, if you’re already planning to visit the Café Apartments, Good Day is one of the 
            better options at the top. You’re really going for the view, the photos, and the experience of being up there. Just don’t expect it to be the best coffee or food you’ll find in the city.
            Would I recommend it? Yeah - for the experience, not the taste. And if someone tells you there’s a better spot in the building, they might be right. But Good Day is still a solid choice if you’re looking to soak in the view and snap a few rooftop shots while sipping something nice.
