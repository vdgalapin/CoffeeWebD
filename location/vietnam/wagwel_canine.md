            Wagwel Canine Coffee isn’t your typical coffee shop - it’s more like a dog rescue center and café hybrid, and that’s exactly what made it stand out. My girlfriend and I found it on TikTok, where people were showing off the adorable dogs, and since she’s a dog lover, we decided to check it out. It was a bit of a ride from our hotel, but she covered the Grab, so off we went.
            <br/>
            At first, we were unsure if we were even in the right place. From the outside, it looked more like an animal shelter than a café - gated, quiet, and honestly a little confusing. But once we stepped in, things started to make sense. The owner, an American guy, greeted us at the entrance. There’s an entrance fee (non-consumable), which felt fair since they’re clearly supporting rescue efforts.
            <br/>
            Inside, it’s a lot more vibrant - dogs walking around, a small café setup, food options, and yes, plenty of dog stands. Some dogs wore colored bandanas that indicated whether they could be pet or not. It’s a good system in theory, but honestly, it made things a bit confusing. Some dogs that could be pet didn’t want to be touched, and others that couldn’t be pet came running for attention. It was cute and chaotic all at once.
            <br/>
            There were also guests bringing their own dogs, which made it even harder to tell which dogs were part of the café and which weren’t. Still, it was a fun place to be if you’re a dog lover - you just have to respect the dogs’ space and accept that not all of them are in the mood for cuddles.
            <br/>
            Now for the surprise: the food and coffee were actually really good. I wasn’t expecting much from a place focused on dogs, but the coffee was strong, flavorful, and the food menu didn’t disappoint. Yes, it’s a bit pricey - probably because it’s foreign-owned and part of the proceeds go toward the rescue efforts - but in this case, it felt worth it.
            They even offer an annual membership program, which felt a little unnecessary for tourists like us, but maybe makes sense for locals who visit often.
            <br/>
            Would I go back? Maybe not regularly, but yes - for the experience, I’d absolutely recommend it. If you’re a dog lover and want to do something different in Ho Chi Minh City, Wagwel Canine Coffee is a fun and memorable stop.
