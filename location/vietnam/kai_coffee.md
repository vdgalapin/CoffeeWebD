            If you're looking for a late-night spot to work, study, or just chill with a decent cup of coffee, Kai Coffee is one of the best 24-hour cafés we found in Ho Chi Minh City. It's a popular place among digital nomads and locals who need a space to focus - and with free Wi-Fi, lots of seating, and solid air conditioning, it checks most of the boxes.
            <br/>
            At first glance, the café looks small from the outside. The ground floor is just a simple counter area for ordering and pickup, nothing too flashy. But once you head upstairs, it’s a whole different story. The second floor opens up into a spacious, fully air-conditioned room with around 30–50 tables, each with power outlets and decent lighting. There’s even free water available on that level, so you don’t need to keep running downstairs. It’s clearly designed with long work sessions in mind.
            <br/>
            The third floor, or what they call the rooftop penthouse, has no air-conditioning, but it offers a relaxed, open-air vibe. Perfect for those who don’t mind the heat and want a more laid-back hangout spot. Just a heads-up though - the stairs are a bit tight. If you’re a bigger person or wearing something not stair-friendly, getting up there might feel a little awkward.
            Now, about the drinks - they’re decent. Nothing mind-blowing, but good enough for a café that’s really more about utility and vibe than craft brews. Since Kai Coffee is a franchise, the coffee has that familiar taste you’d find in similar chains - reliable, but not necessarily unique. Prices are fair for what you get.
            <br/>
            What makes this place stand out isn’t the coffee - it’s the vibe. It’s that kind of place where you can focus, sit down with your laptop, or have a quiet conversation without feeling rushed. Just don’t hang out too long on the second floor during peak hours - people go there to work, and you’ll definitely feel that energy.
            <br/>
            If you’re staying in Ho Chi Minh and need a spot to grind at 2 AM, or just want a reliable, chill place to reset - Kai Coffee is definitely worth a visit.
