            While exploring the Café Apartments in Ho Chi Minh City, we ended up at a café called OOPS - not because we were dying to try it, but because it felt like the most reasonable option at the time. It was close to our hotel, but the walk wasn’t ideal, so we took a quick Grab ride. Once inside the building, we realized there’s no clear list of what cafés are where, so we had to check out each level one by one, which was kind of tiring.
            <br/>
            We stopped at OOPS mostly out of convenience. It was lower in the building, and we were already worn out from walking up and down. The café looked okay - a bit dim and quiet - and it had that typical cozy-but-not-memorable vibe. Nothing stood out about the place, but we were just looking for something affordable and local feeling.
            <br/>
            I ordered a coconut coffee, and my girlfriend got a milk chocolate drink. Both came out as slushies - not what we expected at all. The texture, the taste, the aftertaste... it just didn’t hit right for either of us. The coconut coffee especially was a letdown - too icy, too bland, and not the creamy, bold flavor I usually love in Vietnamese-style drinks.
            <br/>
            Price-wise, it wasn’t terrible, but the taste just didn’t justify the cost. It felt like a “drink and forget” kind of experience - nothing we’d go back for, and not something I’d recommend if you're looking to actually enjoy your coffee.
            <br/>
            If you’re in the Café Apartments and want a satisfying coffee experience, I’d say skip OOPS and take the extra steps (literally) to find something better. There are other spots in the building that are worth the effort - this just wasn’t one of them.
