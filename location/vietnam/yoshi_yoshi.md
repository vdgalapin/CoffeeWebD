            Yoshi Yoshi isn’t exactly a coffee shop - it leans more toward a milk tea joint - but they do offer coffee options, and it was the only nearby spot open late at night during our stay in Ho Chi Minh City. It’s a franchise place, spelled exactly the same twice: Yoshi Yoshi. We weren’t hunting for anything fancy - just something quick to drink before calling it a night - and this place happened to be just down the street from our hotel.
            <br/>
            The shop itself is two stories, with a bright and modern Gen Z vibe. Think neon colors, upbeat music, lots of seating, and a pretty lively atmosphere. The first time we went, we had a bit of trouble finding the entrance because the door was sensor-based - something we don’t often see back in the Philippines. We awkwardly tried to push it at first before realizing how it worked, but it gave us a good laugh.
            <br/>
            Price-wise, Yoshi Yoshi sits in that “not too cheap, not too expensive” sweet spot. If you’re on a date or just want to chill somewhere casual and comfortable without spending too much, this is a solid pick. It's not budget coffee, but it's still affordable.
            <br/>
            We ordered a mix of drinks across our visits - I don’t remember exactly what coffee I got, but I know we tried oolong tea and a few other things too. The menu is huge, more like a milk tea shop than a café, with lots of mix-ins and flavors to choose from. We ended up coming back three times - mostly because my girlfriend liked it (or maybe just liked the excuse to walk back).
            <br/>
            The second floor is actually pretty cool. It has a balcony area at the back with extra tables, great for hanging out, especially if you can snag a quiet spot. That said, the place does get crowded with local teens and Gen Z groups just chilling and being loud, so if you're not into that kind of energy, it might not be your scene.
            <br/>
            Overall, Yoshi Yoshi isn’t a specialty coffee destination - but for late-night drinks, decent prices, and a social atmosphere, it’s a solid option. Would I recommend it? Yeah - especially if you're just looking for a casual spot to hang, sip, and people-watch.
