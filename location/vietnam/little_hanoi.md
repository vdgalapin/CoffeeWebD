            After falling in love with egg coffee at My Coffee, I started hunting down other places to try more - and Little Hanoi kept popping up on TikTok. It’s known as one of the most popular spots in Ho Chi Minh City for a Northern-style café experience, and I was curious. The first time I tried to go, my girlfriend was working, so I dropped by alone. I didn’t end up ordering anything though - turns out they don’t do takeout. A bit of a letdown at the time, but I respected the style. The place gives off this “slow down and stay a while” kind of energy.
            <br />
            A few days later, I convinced my girlfriend to come with me so we could actually sit down and experience it properly - and I’m really glad we did. The vibe inside Little Hanoi is warm, calm, and cozy. It felt like walking into someone’s home, with soft lighting, tasteful furniture, and music that sets the mood just right. It wasn’t dead quiet, but people spoke gently, which gave the space a really peaceful energy.
            <br />
            I went straight for the egg coffee again, obviously - and it was worth it. Small cup, higher price than average, but man, the flavor was rich and smooth. One of the best versions I’ve had. My girlfriend ordered something more familiar - maybe a caramel latte or macchiato - and she enjoyed it too. We also grabbed some food: spring rolls (lumpia-style), and they were surprisingly good for a café snack. Crispy, flavorful, and not overpriced.
            <br />
            Even though Little Hanoi sits on the more premium end of the coffee spectrum, I’d say it’s totally worth it. The whole place just invites you to slow down and soak in the atmosphere - no rush, no noise, just good coffee and a relaxing space to enjoy it.
            <br />
            If you’re in Ho Chi Minh City and want a taste of that Hanoi café charm without flying North, this spot is a must. It’s not just about the coffee - it’s about the feeling you get when you’re there.
