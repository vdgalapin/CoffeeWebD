            We found The Koi Garden Coffee through TikTok and instantly knew we had to check it out. The layout looked wild - tables set up around a koi pond, but not just next to it - over it. The seating is designed like hollow circular platforms built into the pond, so when you’re sitting down, you’re basically surrounded by water and koi fish swimming under and around you. It’s hard to describe, but trust me, the setup is creative and super fun.
            <br/>
            What really surprised us was how clean everything was. With all the fish and water, you’d expect the place to be a little messy or smell off, but it was spotless. The koi pond was well-maintained, and the whole area felt peaceful and fresh - even without air conditioning. They had big fans going and just enough breeze coming off the water to keep us comfortable, which was impressive given how humid it usually is in Vietnam.
            <br/>
            As for the coffee, it was better than I expected. I ordered a cocoa-based coffee drink, and it hit the spot - rich, chocolatey, and refreshing. My girlfriend got something else (don’t ask me what - check the photos), but she seemed to enjoy it too. We also ordered fries, which were fine - nothing crazy, but they did the job. One of the best parts? Feeding the koi. We tossed some food in and watched the frenzy - it added a playful energy to the whole visit.
            <br/>
            Price-wise, it’s slightly on the higher end, but that’s fair considering the unique experience. You’re not just paying for a drink - you’re paying for the atmosphere. The place wasn’t too crowded when we went, which made the experience even more relaxing.
            <br/>
            Would I go back regularly? Probably not. But would I recommend it? Absolutely. The Koi Garden Coffee is one of those places that’s worth visiting at least once, especially if you want a fun twist to your café hunt in Ho Chi Minh City. It’s different, it’s peaceful, and yeah - the fish are part of the charm.
