            Our first café stop in Ho Chi Minh City was a little spot called My Coffee. We hadn’t even checked into our hotel yet when a hotel staff member recommended it. We had time to kill and figured, why not? At first, we were skeptical - it was an open-air setup with tiny chairs and tables outside. From a distance, it looked like one of those street cafés you’d pass by without a second glance. We weren’t sure if it was worth it.
            <br />
            But once we walked in, the vibe started to shift. The guy who greeted us spoke English really well - a nice surprise in a country where that’s not always common. He was warm, welcoming, and made us feel at ease right away. We looked at the menu, and to be honest, the prices were surprisingly cheap - especially compared to what we were used to in the Philippines. That already scored points.
            <br />
            We still had to sit outside on those little plastic stools with the tiny table, which felt a bit awkward at first. But when the drinks arrived? Game changer. I ordered an egg coffee, and it completely blew me away - creamy, rich, sweet, and smooth. It’s the drink that made me fall in love with egg coffee in the first place. My girlfriend had the matcha, and while she said it was a bit powdery, it was still pretty decent for the price.
            <br />
            The location itself had that classic Vietnamese street energy - busy surroundings, people walking by, scooters zooming past - but somehow it still felt peaceful enough to enjoy a good cup of coffee. It’s not a flashy spot, and it’s not in the trendiest area, but My Coffee has something that sticks with you.
            <br />
            If you’re staying nearby, definitely don’t skip this place. It’s not the kind of café you’d travel across the city for, but if you’re in the area, it’s absolutely worth the stop - especially if you’ve never tried egg coffee before. Trust me, you’ll get hooked.
